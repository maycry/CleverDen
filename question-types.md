# Question Types — Brainstorm

## Current
- **Flag → Country**: Show flag, pick from 4 country names.

## Planned

### Country → Flag (Reverse)
Show country name, pick from 4 flags. Feels different — scanning visually instead of reading.

### Match Pairs
4 flags on left, 4 country names on right. Draw lines / drag to connect. Time pressure optional. Mini-game feel within a lesson.

### Map Tap
Show country name or flag → tap where it is on a simplified regional map. Flat SVG map with tappable regions or MapKit with region overlays. The "wow" feature.

### Speed Round
Flag appears → 2 options only → 3 seconds to answer. Binary choice, fast pace. Wrong = streak breaks. Arcade feel.

## Future / Mastery Tier

### Odd One Out
Show 4 flags — 3 share a trait (region, color, etc.), 1 doesn't. "Which doesn't belong?" Tests grouping knowledge.

### Spelling / Type-in
Show flag, type the country name. Hardest tier. Autocomplete optional. Good for mastery/review stages.

### Sequence
"Order these countries from north to south" or by population. Drag to reorder. Different mental model.

### Missing Piece
Show a flag with one element removed or blurred. "Which country's flag is this?" Tests deeper visual memory.

### Category Sort
4-6 flags, drag into 2 buckets: "EU member" vs "Not EU member", "Island nation" vs "Landlocked". Teaches broader concepts.
